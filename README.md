Using the App ********************************************

To run the application, simply type into commandline: python myGui.py

myGui.py takes in information from linkTest.py then plots it into the gui. The print statements are just to demonstrate that the feature clickable objects are functional and you can tell when they are clicked. Additionally, they are created in an iterative way so we just need to pass in our recomendations then go from there. This should serve as a template going forwards. Additionally, later we can work on the UI works and make it more intuitive.

CoefCalcs ************************************************ Runs least squares regression for every possible combination of features. The resulting coefficients are stored in a matrix to be used in "GUI.py". Precalculating the coefficients allows the GUI to run quicker.
